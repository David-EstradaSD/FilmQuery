# Film Query Application

### Overview
This program simulates a command-line application that retrieves film data from MySQL DBMS and displays the information. We utilize Java through an IDE to allow a user to choose options from a displayed menu and submit query data.

### Technical Skills Used
* Java and Eclipse IDE
* MAMP Software & MySQL DBMS
* Databases JDBC
* ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Software Development
* Encapsulation (getter and setter methods)
* Constructors 
* If/Else methods
* While Loops
* User input with Scanner

### How to Run
This program runs on Eclipse IDE and requires a keyboard for menu-based user selection.

### Lessons Learned
I have learned about Object-Relational Mapping and how code can be used to translate data from a relational database into objects and fields of an Object-oriented language application. I also became more comfortable with primary keys and foreign keys to relate entities and attributes of a database.
